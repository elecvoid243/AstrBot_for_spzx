//
// Pinia store for blocking InteractiveChoice parts, **scoped per UMO**.
//
// Why per-UMO scoping (Bug Y1 / Y2 fix):
//
//   The Pinia store is a SPA-wide singleton, but chat history is
//   per-session. A naive flat `Record<request_id, Part>` design
//   pooled *every* session's pending prompts in one bag — switching
//   sessions or hard-refreshing after conversations in three
//   different UMOes injected all five old-session boxes into the
//   newest session's page (a "stack" of stale choices). The
//   `submissionStates` "I already chose option B" ints had the same
//   problem — every session's submission intent was visible in
//   every session.
//
// Fix: double-key by `<umo, request_id>` everywhere, with
// `hydrate(umo)` as the single entry point that owns which session
// is currently live. `hydrate` clears in-memory state for any
// previous umo and only loads the current one from localStorage.
//
// The persistence layout is also nested:
//
//   STORAGE_KEY => Record<umo, Record<request_id, InteractiveChoicePart>>
//   SUBMISSION_STORAGE_KEY => Record<umo, Record<request_id, SubmissionState>>
//   IGNORED_STORAGE_KEY => Record<umo, Record<request_id, true>>
//     (request_ids for which a later user message has "passed over" the
//     choice box; persisted so a hard refresh on a tab whose chat history
//     has already moved on keeps the box collapsed instead of letting the
//     message-sequence re-derive it as still pending.)
//
// Old flat-array persistence (pre-2026-07-04) is dropped on first
// hydrate: any payload that is not a flat object keyed by umo is
// treated as stale and removed from localStorage.

     * User-initiated cancel of a pending choice box.
     *
     * Behaviour:
     *   - Optimistically writes the request_id to
     *     `cancelledStates[umo]` via `markCancelled` so the
     *     originating tab transitions to the "已取消" visual
     *     immediately, without waiting for the round-trip.
     *   - Removes the local `activeChoices[umo][rid]` entry so a
     *     pending-only watcher (e.g. `reconcile`) does not
     *     re-inject the cancelled box. Mirrors `submitChoice`'s
     *     optimistic-removal contract.
     *   - POSTs to the backend cancel endpoint
     *     (`DELETE /api/chat/interactive-choice/{rid}`); the
     *     plugin's registry.remove() cancels the awaiting
     *     asyncio.Future, which makes the ask_user_choice tool's
     *     `except asyncio.CancelledError` branch return
     *     "[User input was cancelled] ..." to the LLM and
     *     broadcast an `interactive_choice_resolved
     *     {reason: "cancelled"}` SSE event for cross-tab
     *     consistency. The markCancelled() above is idempotent so
     *     the eventual SSE event is a no-op here.
     *
     * Network failures: the UI has already flipped to "已取消"
     * (markCancelled is local), so we log + rethrow but do not
     * roll the user-visible state back. The follow-up
     * `reconcile(umo)` will re-derive the cancelled state from
     * the backend's `pending` list once the network is back.
     *
     * Why per-UMO: the cancel is scoped to a single session's
     * pending entry (Bug Y1/Y2 mirror). A typo'd empty `umo`
     * throws via the existing `missingUmo` guard.

     * Why: `interactive_choice` parts arrive via SSE and are appended

     * not persisted as part of chat history. After a hard refresh,

     * re-attach step, `ChatMessageList.vue`'s template (which only

     * `<InteractiveChoiceBox>` from, so the box disappears — which
     * Bug X1 ("刷新后候选框消失") and Bug X2 ("刷新后退化为
     * tool") are.
     *
     * Idempotent: parts already present in any message (matched by
     * `request_id`) are not re-injected. If no bot message exists in
     * the supplied list, orphan parts are left in the store
     * untouched — they will be re-injected on the next call once a
     * bot message becomes available (e.g. after a tab switch lands
     * on a session whose history is loaded asynchronously).
     *
     * Args:
     *   messages: The current message list as seen by `ChatMessageList`.
     *     Declared structurally so the store stays decoupled from
     *     the concrete `ChatRecord` / `MessagePart` union types.
     *   umo: Required. Restricts the scan to this UMO's bucket so
     *     sibling sessions cannot leak their orphan parts onto this
     *     page (Bug Y1).
