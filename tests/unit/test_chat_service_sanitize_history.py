"""Unit tests for the read-path ``ask_user_choice`` history sanitizer.

Author: elecvoid243

§2.2 Amendment F (read-path defence, v2 — interactive_choice-aware widening).

Why this file exists
--------------------
``BotMessageAccumulator._store_tool_call`` / ``_store_tool_call_result``
prevent NEW history rows from carrying two stale ``tool_call`` halves per
``ask_user_choice`` call. Rows persisted BEFORE that filter shipped — or
while an AstrBot process still had the old code loaded — already contain
the broken pair. A hard refresh then surfaces two phantom cards next to
the InteractiveChoiceBox.

``_sanitize_ask_user_choice_tool_call_parts`` is the read-path defence:
it strips the broken halves before the chat API returns history to the
dashboard.

Rule (v2, interactive_choice-aware)
-----------------------------------
The sanitiser runs in one of two modes depending on whether the message
already carries an ``interactive_choice`` part (the canonical
representation written by the plugin's ``chain_type`` event):

* **Message HAS ``interactive_choice``** — every tool_call entry that
  looks like a stale ask_user_choice half is dropped unconditionally.
  This covers the original ``args-only`` half (``name ==
  "ask_user_choice"``) AND the orphan ``synthesised result`` half
  (no ``name`` but has a ``result``) — even when they no longer share
  a call_id in the same message. The runtime always sends ``name`` in
  tool_call events, so a name-less tool_call entry with a result is
  unambiguously the synthesised fallback created by
  ``_store_tool_call_result`` for an ask_user_choice call whose
  ``tool_call`` half was filtered out — never a legitimate other tool.

* **Message has NO ``interactive_choice``** — the conservative pairing
  rule applies: collect ask_user_choice ids in the message and drop
  only those PLUS their paired anonymous result halves. This keeps
  malformed multi-tool messages whose ask_user_choice part somehow
  landed without its box (a pre-feature DB row) cleaned, without
  hiding truly anonymous results that have no ask_user_choice peer.

Other rules pinned by these tests
---------------------------------
1. Real tool calls (with a non-empty ``name`` that is NOT
   ``ask_user_choice``) are preserved even in messages that also have
   an ``interactive_choice`` part (multi-tool round-trip).
2. Non-``tool_call`` parts (text, image, ``interactive_choice``, …) are
   preserved unchanged regardless of their content.
3. Malformed input (``None``, non-list, missing keys, …) never raises
   and never reshapes corrupted entries into ``{}``.
4. The bot-record wrapper only touches rows whose content is a bot
   message; user rows and rows with non-bot content are passed through.
